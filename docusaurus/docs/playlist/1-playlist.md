## 1 How I Could Just Kill a Man, Rage Against the Machine

[Verse 1]
Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah of the funky Buddha
Eluder of the fucked up styles that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it
'Cause we're like outlaws stridding
Suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush
When they see me driving by
Hanging out my window
And my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kinda loco
I'm just another local kid
From the street getting paid for my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

[Chorus 1]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

[Verse 2]
I've been doin' all the dumb shit, yo, because nothin' is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around, I got ya humming
Hummin', comin' at ya
Then you know I had to gat ya
Time for some action, just a fraction of friction (Uh)
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shining a battle light
Swing out the gat, and I know that we'll gat you right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, "Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed out
How do you like my chrome?" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did any way
Ha ha ha ha ha! Young punk had to pay
So I just killed the man

[Chorus 1]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

[Bridge]
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite you with these site
So if you ain't down
Bullshit

[Verse 3]
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would call the one time and play the role model?
No, I think you'll play like a thug
Next, hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming, coming at ya!
Yeah, you know I'm gonna to gat ya
How do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, yo, I gotta say, "Fuck it"

[Refrain]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

[Outro]
How I could just kill a man
How I could just kill a man

## 2 Movement In The Light, Fishbone

There's a path for you and I to follow
For our goals aren't always in our sight
But now you've come to dread and fear tomorrow
Were your dreams killed in your sleep last night ?

Fight for what is right...
Pray for a movement in the light

Some are slaves to Rhyme, Wit and Reason
Some are slave to all of what they hear
To sing a different song is outright treason
Is the price of freedom what they fear ?

This cannot be right...
Pray for the movement in the light

Hey... Hey... There's a light to guide the way
Hey... Hey... The light has brought another day

For you and I should ever come together
Turn away the hatred in your heart
For we should find a peace to last forever
Find the peace no man can tear apart

May all the world unite
Pray for the movement in the light
