Here's my two cents: the Brazilian people is so fucking amazing, so fucking intense, that even our patience is excessive. Patience is a very important trait to have to navigate this world and this life. It's pretty important to have it so your brain doesn't fry like fish in batter.

But what exactly is this patience I'm talking about? Well, it's for everything... From hosting a gringo in Brazil with the realization that you're just gonna let him do whatever the fuck he likes over here, to putting up with all the vultures eating Brazil from inside out yonder at the corrupt council that simply won't melt away. This land, Brazil, is ours. It belongs to those who were here before they arrived, to those who were brought and to those they bred with. Brazil is all of this, a cocktail of stuff put together aimlessly, and maybe this aimlessness is just our way, the best way. And, if we are all this, why in all fuck should we suffer those who don't appreciate us, who don't appreciate our culture, our people or our nature? How long are we going to let this abuse go on!?
