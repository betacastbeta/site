So once I wrote a sexist something without knowing it was sexist. I was misinterpreted twice.

Being misinterpreted for the first time is a serious matter, when it happens a second time it's dangerously serious. First time was by people who didnâ€™t understand what I meant. It's so sad realizing you end up subtracting when all you wanna do is add. Second time I misinterpreted myself. It's exasperating to think that there might be something in here that I can't see and that I need to root out. It's a good thing that people are all so kind to me and help me see things in myself that I myself can't see.

A true boxer must know when to have his guard raised and when to lower it.

POW! Thanks.
