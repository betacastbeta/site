Here's what's happening to the world and the internet. People are now able to see much more of other people's intimate lives than they're able to assimilate. There are all kinds of situations. From birth to sex to death. By all kinds of people, famous and anonymous. All these events have a context. Several of the parties involved participated with some baggage.
But because the volume of situations is huge, we need to fill that gap, and what remains are our assumptions.

And then you start to grow apart. Friends of 30 years are growing apart, repugnant politicians are being elected and taking the reins of the world. I can't be the only one who thinks this is all very crazy. According to the law of entropy, there's a trend for this movement to keep expanding in the same direction. I hope not, because as much as we are atoms, we are so much more as well. If living is not doing right, I don't know what it is. So shall we get our shit together and live in closer proximity to the situations we are able to assimilate with empathy!?
