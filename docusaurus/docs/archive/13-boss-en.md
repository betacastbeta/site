I work for the government. There you go. Can you believe it? I code bots that search for data everywhere and compile said data so as to help the decision makers do something more rational.

Regardless of who's in office, I have always done my work in the same way, for the following reason: there is no A, B, Red, Blue, Left, Right without ulterior motives (this is me being polite). So, the better I do my job, the more embarrassed I make these cunts when justifying an unjustifiable decision they make.

In other words, my boss is, has always been and will always be you, the Brazilian citizen.
