In every cycle, there comes a time when a bunch of useless fucking middlemen who are shit in everything but in getting their paycheck - like those fucking real estate agent cunts - just so they can wet their whistle a little, the fucks.
The other day, however, I heard a different story. Better yet, it was the same story, but the other way around. A lessee wanted her rent to go up, whereas the lessor would have none of that shit.

That got me wondering... How does that even happen? That's absurd! Instead of thinking only of themselves, they were thinking of each other.
It's my undying with that all of us are lucky enough to go through an awkward moment like this at least once in our lives as well.
