Hey, guys, if you make art as living, please holler at me. I have been, I shit you not, trying to do that for over 10 years, which is curiously the same amount time I've been hitting my to a wal.

Like, my art dies if I gotta meet a deadline and it blooms 10+ times better if no deadline is involved. So I'm actually very ignorant on this.

But the main thing on all of this is: there's no control.

That's my free tip of the day to you (and I could actually use that too).
