The social network of the future is called GitHub. And by future I don't mean it's going to get the living shit hyped out of it. By future I mean the one who's going to BUILD the future. I kid you not. This shit was invented by github guys and Linus Torvalds - there he goes again, the dude guy who made Linux, that operating system that you can't even fathom to be much simpler to use than Windows.

But it is still a social network. I don't know much about the other social networks, but in GitHub you create your profile in the same way: photo, about, your likes... But you don't post photos, texts, not even 200 character posts, nor do you show off your amazing even though it ain't. There you publish your work. But it's not just any work. It’s code. So, by reading the code of this "match", you find out the coding savvy that person/project has, what it's involved in, if these are more voluntary projects or from some major capitalist corporation, what programming language that person is more experienced in, etc. For example, I just finished writing this and realized that a code speaks louder than 1000 pictures.

About resistance and revolution. This shit is a social network. If you post it there, it's never gonna be yours again. Everyone uses it. You won't make a dime out of it. Like that revenge porn that fucks everybody. But, in this case, no one gets fucked. Like is called a "pull request" and it's a reply to your code improving it.

If that is not resistance and revolution, I don’t know what is. Such camaraderie this IT crowd has. That's because these motherfuckers have huge hearts and don’t want people to go through as much trouble as they did. So they write an amazing manual for free telling you how to run from a miserable afternoon.

Habemus hope.
