This internet business really is the craziest shit I've ever seen. It's crazy when I think that I can instantaneously access pretty much all of recorded human knowledge whenever I want. It's cray cray. Crazeeey! (Okay, you get the point)

But now shit's about the get even crazier. What I just said is crazy enough, but I can also access thousands of ordinary situations taking place in the lives of others. I can't even thing adjectives for that one.

Because of that I saw a video of a woman doing hardcore porn in a family environment, hence disturbing everyone and not giving a shit. A true firefighter never quits. That's the one who put out the fire in that bimbo's ass and was magnanimous enough to say that a lot of people were bothered by that, but she had to kill that fire by herself.

That's when I remember Pastor King. THE ULTIMATE TRAGEDY IS NOT THE OPPRESSION AND CRUELTY BY THE BAD PEOPLE BUT THE SILENCE OVER THAT BY THE GOOD PEOPLE.

Firefighters. We're hiring! We pay very well.
