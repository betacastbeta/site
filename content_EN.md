I learned they're the enemy. When the red and blue flashes, I immediately go ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù. I‚Äôm fucked!! They'll see I messed up... But what was it that I messed up again!?

Then life comes back...

...in a carburated ride of a dream of bringing the sea to the highlands (an unnecessarily long alias for a short name: Dune Buggy). Lo and behold, the apocalypse motor vehicle, almighty, pulls over next to me. Maya is riding shotgun, the left turn light is hanging out, license plate rusty as fuck, the car registration is way expired and there's just loads of colors, just to show how colorful life is. My fate therefore was dead obvious... Great. Now it's my turn. I am fucked.

From out of nowhere I gaze, looking guilty of nothing and everything, I stare at the enemy. Covid mask, sunglasses, hideous as fuck hat and wearing an ensemble that looks like a suit, the rat... I mean, the cop, waves... He was giving me a shaka, absolutely psyched with the ride.

You live and learn. Now I‚Äôm fucked. Thanks. üôè
