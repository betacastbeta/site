I learned they're the enemy. When the red and blue flashes, I immediately go “holy shit”. I’m fucked!! They'll see I messed up... But what was it that I messed up again!?

Then life comes back...

...in a carburated ride of a dream of bringing the sea to the highlands (an unnecessarily long alias for a short name: Dune Buggy). Lo and behold, the apocalypse motor vehicle, almighty, pulls over next to me. Maya is riding shotgun, the left turn light is hanging out, license plate rusty as fuck, the car registration is way expired and there's just loads of colors, just to show how colorful life is. My fate therefore was dead obvious... Great. Now it's my turn. I am fucked.

From out of nowhere I gaze, looking guilty of nothing and everything, I stare at the enemy. Covid mask, sunglasses, hideous as fuck hat and wearing an ensemble that looks like a suit, the rat... I mean, the cop, waves... He was giving me a shaka, absolutely psyched with the ride.

You live and learn. Now I’m fucked. Thanks. 🙏

Dirty dishes, slime dangling on the table, magic sand (it takes one real unwise motherfucker to come up with shit like that) methodically spread out throughout the house as if it were the richest of spices dressing the art of a careful chef, meeting with the team and child hunger.

PLAC! Something broke! Let's go see what happened.

- Daddy. It was your fault. You left it there.
- But you were the one who kicked it. Everything that takes place in this house is equal parts me and you.

I was halfway making a huge point with my colleagues and only had time to say: hold on. I rush back, showing how committed I am to that shit.

Life sometimes has a way to make us negligent to certain things. It's naturally justifiable. I sweep the broken pieces into a bag and rest it on the floor.

Crying is heard! The type of crying that hurts a lot more than our own. Maya cut her foot. I despair. A lot more than if it had been me. But as we grow we learn that we need to keep it all down so as to deal with the crisis.

My seed is now sprouting...

- (crying) Daddy, did you take the bag out of there?
- I did, sweetie.
- Good. You could have stepped on it too.

# #3 Out of where, you cheeky fuck?

Let's agree to speak nothing but the truth here. Everyone knows that women are light years ahead of men. I mean it. And that's not a problem. This is not (or rather should not be) a contest. We should thank them for stopping this shit from bursting all this time and just give them the ball to do with as they please.

But, I mean, I was born man, right!? There's also the coolest partnership between us. And teams can follow all combinations... Men, women, homosexuals. Then I start using the established classification so as to simplify understanding it and am overcome with such laziness. People, right?

But today I wear the men's jersey. You are smarter in everything, but there's one thing you're missing out on. Every man is absolutely right when they don’t take the trash out.

Let me explain: You can't get out. It's all staying here. The Earth is not out. The creek right over there is not out. The raven pecking at a cigarette stub is surely not out. So, my dear companion, take it easy next time the trash can is overflowing with beer cans and you can't even get mad because tying the bag close is a no go.

# #4 MADNESS: Too much fires for too few firefighters. We're hiring!

This internet business really is the craziest shit I've ever seen. It's crazy when I think that I can instantaneously access pretty much all of recorded human knowledge whenever I want. It's cray cray. Crazeeey! (Okay, you get the point)

But now shit's about the get even crazier. What I just said is crazy enough, but I can also access thousands of ordinary situations taking place in the lives of others. I can't even thing adjectives for that one.

Because of that I saw a video of a woman doing hardcore porn in a family environment, hence disturbing everyone and not giving a shit. A true firefighter never quits. That's the one who put out the fire in that bimbo's ass and was magnanimous enough to say that a lot of people were bothered by that, but she had to kill that fire by herself.

That's when I remember Pastor King. THE ULTIMATE TRAGEDY IS NOT THE OPPRESSION AND CRUELTY BY THE BAD PEOPLE BUT THE SILENCE OVER THAT BY THE GOOD PEOPLE.

Firefighters. We're hiring! We pay very well.

So once I wrote a sexist something without knowing it was sexist. I was misinterpreted twice.

Being misinterpreted for the first time is a serious matter, when it happens a second time it's dangerously serious. First time was by people who didn’t understand what I meant. It's so sad realizing you end up subtracting when all you wanna do is add. Second time I misinterpreted myself.

It's exasperating to think that there might be something in here that I can't see and that I need to root out. It's a good thing that people are all so kind to me and help me see things in myself that I myself can't see.

A true boxer must know when to have his guard raised and when to lower it.

POW! Thanks.

# #7 The World, the Internet, the Thesis and The Invitation

Here's what's happening to the world and the internet. People are now able to see much more of other people's intimate lives than they're able to assimilate. There are all kinds of situations. From birth to sex to death. By all kinds of people, famous and anonymous. All these events have a context. Several of the parties involved participated with some baggage.
But because the volume of situations is huge, we need to fill that gap, and what remains are our assumptions.

And then you start to grow apart. Friends of 30 years are growing apart, repugnant politicians are being elected and taking the reins of the world. I can't be the only one who thinks this is all very crazy. According to the law of entropy, there's a trend for this movement to keep expanding in the same direction. I hope not, because as much as we are atoms, we are so much more as well. If living is not doing right, I don't know what it is. So shall we get our shit together and live in closer proximity to the situations we are able to assimilate with empathy!?
